# Designing with spatial data for the web

![Designing with spatial data](img/header.png)

## Introduction

This workshop is designed to be very hands-on, with many examples that can be
extended as exercises. It would be impossible to touch everything that we could
find [interesting in web mapping](https://hi.stamen.com/an-ode-to-d3-js-projections-9d6477d6da0b#.1hr10rltk),
so the hope is that after going through these three acts you will feel empowered
to swap in your own data and leverage [hundreds of examples](http://blockbuilder.org/search#api=d3.geo.path) in your own data visualization projects!

# Prelude: the landscape

## Servers and clients, rasters and vectors

# Act I: data is part of design

## Data preparation

## Generalization

* Mapshaper and TopoJSON
  * generalization is not just for file size, it's also important for the _look_ of the map
  * [Use the Brexit data as example]

* A tour through the wonderful world of Natural Earth datasets
  * Not just what are they, but _why_ are they

* Data precision
  * You don't really need those 8 digits in your decimal degrees

# Act II: numbers to images

## Projections

_Why_ do they matter?

## Classification and choropleths

AKA how to lie with maps:

Equal Interval, Quantiles, Natural Breaks
(Note that names from GIS are not the same as in D3)

[Example: value-by-alpha US election]

## Labels

## Legends

* Make your legend a chart!

# Act III: bringing it all together

## Leaflet layer stacking

* [Nat Geo Amazonia examples]

## Designing with big(-ish) data

* Playing with opacity

* Heatmaps: love them or hate them

* Hexbins [caliparks examples]

## Linked views

* [Examples from American Panorama]

## Some thoughts on design
...culminate with some general design principles and talk about the design process w/ ER
